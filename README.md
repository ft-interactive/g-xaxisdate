# xaxisDate

Pre styled and positioned date x-axis for use with the FT's g-chartframe architecture as part of the Visual Vocabulary. As the name suggests it creates a date x-axis that can be appended to the .plot obejct in the g-chartframe hopefully eliminating the need to code another standard x-axis.

Will also work with other builds where the axis is called into an svg.

The [d3 library](https://d3js.org/) is already installed in the build
